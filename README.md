 Budget tracker app  

 

Introduction  

 

The project is all about creating an android application that is designed to track the user’s budget .The project was completed on android studio using the Kotlin language . 

 

About the application. 

 

The budget tracker app is an application that consists of 3 screens  irrespective of order which simply the welcome screen , the income screen , and the expenses screen .this  would then mean that my entire program consists of at least 6 source code files . 

 
About the main screen. 

The first screen displays the user’s current balance , the total incured expenses , as well as the total income in the account for the current period .this same screen also  has two buttons , the income button and the expenses button which lead the user to the respective screen depending on the button they choose to press . 

About the income screen . 

The income screen allows the user to input their desired amounts they would the program to verify against what the application’s system has then return a balance either positive or negative .  

The second screen is also designed in such a way that it keeps track of the what the different amounts for the income accumulated throughout a certain financial period . 

About the expenses screen . 

Similarly to the income screen the expenses screen also allows the user to input their desired amounts they would the program to verify against what the application’s system has then return a balance either positive or negative .   

The second screen is also designed in such a way that it keeps track of the what the different amounts for the expenses incurred throughout a certain financial period . 


Challenges faced and areas of improvement . 

Overall the project was challenging , however not really in a negative way . It was a good type of challenging as it sort of assisted in the improvement of my understanding of  how to use android studio with kotlin and the different functions offered . 

The only big challenge I  was faced with in  the duration of me working on this project would be the adding and linking some of the fuction on the different screens  for them to be executed well when the application runs smoothly.
